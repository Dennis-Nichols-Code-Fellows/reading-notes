# Class 30 - Hash Map

## Hash Map Definitions

- Hash Function: A function that maps keys to indices in the array.

- Hash Table: A data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array.

- Load Factor: The ratio of number of items in the hash table to the size of the hash table.

- Collision: When two or more keys map to the same index in the hash table.

- Collision Resolution: The strategy used to resolve collisions and store multiple values at the same index in the hash table.

- Separate Chaining: A collision resolution strategy where each index in the hash table is a linked list of items that hash to the same value.
