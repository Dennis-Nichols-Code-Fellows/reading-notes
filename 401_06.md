# Code 401 - class 06 notes

## Random module

- You can use the random module to pick a random number in a given range, pick a random element from a python list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin, etc.
- `randint()` generates a random integer chosen from a given range defined by two integers (inclusive).
- `random()` generates a random floating point number chosen from between 0 and 1 inclusive.
- `choice()` generates a random choice from a collection object like a list, set, tuple, etc..
- `shuffle()` shuffles the elemets of a list in place.
- `randrand()` lets you generate a custome range and then randomly select an element from it.

## Risk analysis

"In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test." [Edureka blog](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)

- We can use risk analysis to help us come up with a plan for testing our software.

**We can rank the risks as seen below:**

High: means the effect of the risk would be very high and non-tolerable. The company might face loss.

Medium: it is tolerable but not desirable. The company may suffer financially but there is a limited risk.

Low: it is tolerable. There lies little or no external exposure or no financial loss.  [Edureka blog](https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/)


## Test coverage

Don't focus on the number value of coverage that a test coverage tool returns to you, it's just for directing you towards untested risks in the code.

In fact, trying to meet some numerical mark might cause yout to test for frivolous things and not search for the real issues.

The author says you are testing enough if:

- You rarely get bugs that escape into production.
- You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.

You should still pay attention to what the coverage tools tell you about which areas of the code are not being covered.
