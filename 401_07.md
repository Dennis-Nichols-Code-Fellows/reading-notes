## Python Scope

### Understanding scope

**Global scope**: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code. These are defined outside of all functions.

**Local scope**: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope. These are defined within a function.

#### Names and scope in Python

Assigning variables, defining functions and classes, importing modules, etc all create new Python names.

Python uses the location of the name assignment or definition to associate it with a particular scope. In other words, where you assign or define a name in your code determines the scope or visibility of that name.

#### Scope v Namespace

Python scopes are implemented as dictionaries and these dictionaries are commonly called *namespaces*. The dictionaries for each object (and the overall module/file) are stored in a special attribute called `__dict__`.

You can use `sys.keys()` to access the global namespace.

## The LEGB rule is how Python resolves names

- **Local** (or function) scope is the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression.
- **Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope** is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function.
- **Global (or module) scope** is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names that you define at the top level of a program or a module.
- **Built-in scope** is a special Python scope that’s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session. This scope contains names such as keywords, functions, exceptions, and other attributes that are built into Python.

### Local Scope

The local scope or function scope is a Python scope created at function calls. Every time you call a function, you’re also creating a new local scope. On the other hand, you can think of each def statement and lambda expression as a blueprint for new local scopes. 

You can avoid name collisions in your programs by properly using the local Python scope. This also makes functions more self-contained and creates maintainable program units. Additionally, since you can’t change local names from remote places in your code, your programs will be easier to debug, read, and modify.

### Modules: The Global Scope

From the moment you start a Python program, you're in the global scope.
Behind the scenes, your program's main script is turned into a module called `__main__`. The namespace of this module is the global scope.

Whenever you assign a value to a name in Python, one of two things can happen:

- You create a new name
- You update an existing name

The concrete behavior will depend on the Python scope in which you’re assigning the name. If you try to assign a value to a global name inside a function, then you’ll be creating that name in the function’s local scope, shadowing or overriding the global name. This means that you won’t be able to change most variables that have been defined outside the function from within the function.
