# Class 31 Notes

## Django REST Framework

- The reading didn't really get into the actual implementation of a REST API with Django. But it does tell us that it relies on us using the Django REST API framework. 
- The reading from Will Vincent that Ian linked too was very helpful though. It shows how you can set up a pretty interactive REST API interface with Django. It also showed that you can associate certain records only with certain users which was cool.

## Docker

This reading finally helped me understand what a docker container is. I didn't realize it's just building off of a linux environment.

I found this example to be particularly helpful:

- A Dockerfile is the recipe for a cake
- An image is a snapshot of the recipe at a given time
- A docker-compose.yml says how to make the cake
- And the container is the actual, baked cake
