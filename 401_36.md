## Whiteboard interview advice

Whiteboard-style interviews are a common practice in the tech industry, where candidates are asked to solve technical questions on a whiteboard, piece of paper, or computer. The environment can be stressful and cause even the most competent engineer to struggle. The best advice for a successful whiteboard interview is to communicate. The author suggests taking some important steps before solving the problem, such as restating the question to confirm understanding, asking about edge cases, asking about test cases, writing pseudocode and asking if it makes sense, converting pseudocode into actual code and asking if it looks good, and asking for help if needed. Additionally, candidates should communicate with HR or interview point of contact prior to the interview to gather information about the interview format and what to prepare. Above all, it's important to remember that the interviewer has been in the candidate's position and to approach the interview in a conversational manner.

## Seven steps to technical interviews

- Take a few minutes to think through the problem before speaking.
- Write down the steps of the solution before coding.
- Write pseudocode first to verify the logic.
- Don't sweat the small stuff, focus on the big picture, and be able to look up information.
- Sit down, be humble and accept criticism.
- Come prepared by putting in the time and studying.
- Review your work for algorithmic efficiency and correctness.
