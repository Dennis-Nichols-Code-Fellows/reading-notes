**2.Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?**

- I would try to pick a good base color for their site and then use a palette generator off of that color to find some other good colors for accents.

**3.What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?**

- You want to pick a font that is 'web-safe' and generally available across all platforms. (MDN docs)

**4.What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?**
