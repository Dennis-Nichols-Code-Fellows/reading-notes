1. In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

- 100’s = Informational codes, acknowledgment of receipt of a request.

1. Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?
We don't want to send it to github and give someone else access to our database.

2. What is middleware?
Software that runs when a sever gets a request but before it gets to your routes.

3. What does app.use(express.json()) do?
Let's you accept JSON as the body of your request.

4. What does the /:id mean in a route?
The colon designates this as parameter so we can access the id of a request.

5. What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?
PUT updates the whole db entry but PATCH updates just a single variable.

6. How do you make a default value in a schema?
Use 'default:'.

7. What does a 500 error status code mean?
Error with the server.

8. What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?
200: “Everything is OK.” This is the code that is delivered when a web page or resource acts exactly the way it's expected to. 201: “Created.” The server has fulfilled the browser's request, and as a result, has created a new resource. -kinsta.com
