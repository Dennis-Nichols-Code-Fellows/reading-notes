# Code 401 - 'Engineering' Reading Notes

1. Whatâ€™s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
    - I think it's unlikely that many people bring the combination of different experiences I've had. To be fair that's what makes any of us unique. My experience and training ranges from nuclear power, to neuroscience, to environmental health research, to public health project management, and now software development. This proves that I can adapt to a large range of circumstances and have a lot of curiosity to constantly learn new things.

2. Three things I'll do to unstick myself whenever I get stuck on a piece of code or logic, etc.
    - I like to get outside and move around in the sun.
    - I take advantage of switching environments like going from my apartment to a coffee shop or vice versa.
    - If it's not urgent, I'll sleep on it.
