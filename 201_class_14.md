**1.What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**

- With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted. (shay howe's site)

**2.How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**

- Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off. (shay howe's site)
