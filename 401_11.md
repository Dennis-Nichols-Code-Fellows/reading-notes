## Jupyter Notebooks

The linked video was a good overview of notebooks in general and jupyter labs in particular.
Python notebooks can be used to run code in an experimental fashion with the output shown right in the same document.
Notebooks also allow the interweving of text blocks along with the code.

Jupyter is able to handle many different file types.

Other notebook implementations include:

- Google CoLab
- Kaggle
- Running notebook files in PyCharm

## Numpy

Numpy is one of the primary mathematical libraries used by the python community.
Many different libraries are built around Numpy because of its speed and other capabilities.
Numpy also has performance improvements compared to native Python because it is implemented in C, a compiled language.

One of the most important features of numpy is the numpy array. These arrays are much more memory efficient than Python lists and thus faster to work with. This makes numpy especially useful in fields with a lot of matrix computation like machine learning.
