## [6 reasons for pair programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

- Work environment readiness

Learning from fellow students. It's good to get different perspectives on how to solve a problem.

3. How does pair programming work?

"Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer."
