1. What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).
It does not cause any observable side effects.

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
Code is easier to test.

4. What is immutability?
When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created.

5. What is Referential transparency?
Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

1. What is a module?
Just another JS file apart from the main app that we use to store code that solves a certain problem and keeps our code easier to manage.

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
Allows us to use other modules in our app.

3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
Usew require.

4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
We have to export it.
