# Psychological Safety Article

## Takeaways

The key concept of this article was that successful teams seem to have certain group norms, chief among these being 'Psychological Safety".
Two components of psych-safety are:

- Members of a group speak in roughly equal proportion -> evryone has a chance to say what they need to say.
- Members of the group have high social sensitivity -> they are good at assessing the feelings of others. This allows them to adjust their behaviour accordingly.

Basically, the effectiveness of a team is not determined by the individual abilities of its members. Rather, the emergent social dynamics of the group are determined by how socially safe its members feel. That in turn usually leads to higher performance.
