### Questions

**1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means..**

- You specify the content to be arranged in either rows or columns but not both.


**2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**

- The main axis is the axis running in the direction the flex items are laid out in (for example, as rows across the page, or columns down the page.)
- The cross axis is the axis running perpendicular to the direction the flex items are laid out in. (MDN docs)

**3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?**

- The visual presentation of the intended reading order of elements may not necessarily match the DOM order and screen readers may then read things in a confusing order.

**1. What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?**

**2. How does this topic connect with your long term goals?**

- Anything that improves CSS positioning will make my life easier in the long run.
