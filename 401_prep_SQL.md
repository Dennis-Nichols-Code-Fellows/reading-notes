# Code 401 Prepwork - SQL

A relational database consists of many different data tables which are linked together in some way by shared information.

The tables in the database are 2-dimensional data structures where each row is an entry in the database and each column is a feature.

Tables are linked together by matching their entries on shared keys. For example (From the bolt exercises) you might have a database of movie information. One table might basic information about a movie (like its director, release date, etc) and another table might have boxoffice sales information for each movie. Each table would have a unique ID column for the movies in question and this id allows the data from different tables to be connected.
