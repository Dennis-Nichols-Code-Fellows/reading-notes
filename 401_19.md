# Code 401 - Class 19 Notes

## Regex

The `re` library is used to work with regular expressions, which are tools for matching patterns in text. Regular expressions are a way to describe a set of strings using a concise, formal syntax.

This library contains many functions that can be used to search for and manipulate strings based on regular expressions. Some of the most commonly used functions include:

re.search(pattern, string): Searches for the first occurrence of the given pattern in the string and returns a match object if a match is found.

re.findall(pattern, string): Returns a list of all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string.

re.sub(pattern, repl, string): Replaces all occurrences of the pattern in the string with the given replacement string.


## shutil library

The shutil (shell utilities) library in Python is used for a number of high-level file operations, such as copying and deleting files and directories. It is a more convenient way of manipulating files than the lower-level os library, which is typically used for more specific operations on files and directories.

You can use `shutil` to copy files, copy directories and their contents, move files and directories, delete same, and compress or decompress files. A common use case for the `shutil` library is in data science workflows that involve pre-processing of data. This library can also be useful in programmatically compressing large numbers of files.
