## List comprehensions

A python list comprehension needs 3 main ingredients to work:

- An expression we want to carry out
- The object we want the expression to work on
- The itearable object (list, tuple, dictionary, string, set, etc) that each object comes from.

### Range()

One use for list comprehension is to generate a list of numbers in sequential order using the range(function).

```python
# construct a basic list using range() and list comprehensions
# syntax
# [ expression for item in list ]
digits = [x for x in range(10)]

# Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

### Other uses of list comprehension

- make a list the first letter of each word in a list of words
- return each character separately in a list from a text string
- Convert all letters of a list to lower or upper case

**You can even return each line of a text file in a list like so:**

```python
# open the file in read-only mode
file = open("dreams.txt", 'r')
poem = [ line for line in file ]

for line in poem:
    print(line)
```
