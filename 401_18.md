## Encryption, Decryption, and Hacking reading / video / Caesar cipher

Encryption is the basis for secure interactions on the web.
It ensures that your connection with your bank is safe, verifies you are who you claim to be, and enables data to be shared safely between two parties without someone else intercepting it.

One of the most simple encryption schemes is a **substition cipher**. This is achieved by replacing each character of a text with another character according to a specific algorithm. The c**aesar cypher** is an example of an incredibly simple substitution cypher whereas the Enigma code used by the Germans in WWII was a more complex example.

These are both examples of **symmetric encryption** techniques wherein the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt the data. In the case of the caesar cipher, this refers to the shift number, in the case of Enigma, this refers to the starting positions of the rotors used on the encrypting and decrypting machines.

The security of an encryption scheme relates to the length of the keys as well as how it deals with word/letter frequencies. Modern symmetric encryption uses keys that are 128 bits long and thus impossible to brute force.

There are also **assymetric encryption** techniques in use today. The most prominent use of these techniques is in public key crytography. This method uses different keys for encryption and decryption. Each user / computer involved generates a public and private key. The parties involved exchange their public keys. The sending computer then encrypts the data to be shared using the receiving computer's public key and a mathematical operation. The data can be sent to the receiver now and they receiver decrypts it using their private key.

There is a lot of math involved.
