# Class 2 - The Coder's Computer

These notes cover an introduction to **text editors** and **the command line interface (CLI)**.

## [Choosing a text editor](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf)

In this article by 'The Older Coder' on *Medium* the author lays out some ideas for how to choose between different text editors.

The first and perhaps main point is that **the best text editor is the one you are most comfortable using** while still being able to perform all required tasks.

Important features in a text editor:

1. Code completion -> auto closing of tags, html/css shorthand, etc.
2. Syntax highlighting -> allows one to distinguish elements of a language like html from the content itself, improves legibility.
3. Variety of themes (such as 'dark' themes to give your eyes a break)
4. Includes a healthy library of extensions -> additional software that can make the editor more powerful down the road.

## The Command Line Interface (CLI)

### Basic Reading Notes

[The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)

- The CLI (also called the terminal) is a powerful alternative to a GUI
- Both input and output are text-based
- Different OSs have different means of accessing the CLI
- The window interface represents the terminal to you is called the *shell*
- A popular shell is called *Bash*
- Article ends with pointing out that there are shortcuts available to make the CLI more easy to navigate.
