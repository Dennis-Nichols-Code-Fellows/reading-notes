## [Video and Audio Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content)

### Questions

**1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.**

- "The first influx of online videos and audio were made possible by proprietary plugin-based technologies like Flash and Silverlight. Both of these had security and accessibility issues, and are now obsolete, in favor of native HTML solutions <video> and <audio> elements " (MDN docs)

**2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.**

- The `<src>` attribute:  In the same way as for the <img> element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. (MDN docs)

- The `<controls>` attribute: provides a way to control the video, either with the browser's interface or another API.

**3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?**

- "This will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the <video> element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers. (MDN docs)

**4. Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.**

`<Video>` killed the `<audio>` tag
`<Video>` killed the `<audio>` tag
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind, we've gone too far

## [Responsive images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

**1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?**

- It improves performance of the site by not downloading unnecessarily large images for small screens.

**2. Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.**

- srcset defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. (MDN docs)
- sizes defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true. (MDN docs)

**2. How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?**

- When the browser starts to load a page, it starts to download (preload) any images before the main parser has started to load and interpret the page's CSS and JavaScript. That mechanism is useful in general for reducing page load times, but it is not helpful for responsive images. (MDN docs)
