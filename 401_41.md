## Next dynamic routes

Next lets you set up page paths that depend on external data. This lets you for example have a folder with your pages directory that gives a dynamic path based on the names of the files it contains. Example: `/posts/<file_id>`. This process relies on 'getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps`.

`getStaticPaths` is used to define the set of possible dynamic paths for a page. It returns an object with a paths property, which is an array of objects, each representing a unique URL path for the page. The object returned by getStaticPaths is used to determine the list of pages that should be generated at build time. This function is only executed on the server, and its results are passed to the component associated with the page during the build process.

`getStaticProps` is used to retrieve the data that is needed to render a specific dynamic page. It is called for each dynamic page and returns an object with a props property, which is passed to the component as props. The function is executed on the server at build time for static pages, and on the client for pages that are dynamically loaded. This function provides a way to retrieve data from APIs, databases, or other sources, and pass it to the component as props.

## Deployment of NextJS sites on Vercel

Deploying a Next.js application on Vercel is really easy, as the platform is optimized for Next.js out of the box. Simply connect your Vercel account to your GitHub or GitLab repository, select your Next.js project, and Vercel will automatically detect the necessary configuration and build settings. Vercel will also generate a unique URL for your application, which can be customized with a custom domain.
