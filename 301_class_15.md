## [What is Oauth?](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3216404/what-is-oauth-how-the-open-authorization-framework-works.html)

1. What is OAuth?
OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial, related, single logon credential. -CSOonline.com

2. Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.
The simplest example of OAuth is when you go to log onto a website and it offers one or more opportunities to log on using another website’s/service’s logon. You then click on the button linked to the other website, the other website authenticates you, and the website you were originally connecting to logs you on itself afterward using permission gained from the second website. -CSOOnline.com

3. How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?

- Authorization is the process of letting a subject access resources after a successful authentication, oftentimes somewhere else.
- OAuth essentially allows the user, via an authentication provider that they have previously successfully authenticated with, to give another website/service a limited access authentication token for authorization to additional resources.
- The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.
- The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.
- The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.
- The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).
- If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.
- The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.
- The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).
- The user gives the approved access token to the first website.
- The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.
- The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.
- The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.

4. What is OpenID?
OpenID is for humans logging into machines, OAuth is for machines logging into machines on behalf of humans.

## [Authorization and Authentication flows](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow)

1. What is the difference between authorization and authentication?
Authentication is the user proving the own or have been given access to a resource. Authorization is the user telling one machine to give another machine access to its resources on the user's behalf.

2. What is Authorization Code Flow?
The user clicks Login within the regular web application.

- Auth0's SDK redirects the user to the Auth0 Authorization Server (
/authorize
endpoint).
- Your Auth0 Authorization Server redirects the user to the login and authorization prompt.
- The user authenticates using one of the configured login options and may see a consent page listing the permissions Auth0 will give to the regular web application.
- Your Auth0 Authorization Server redirects the user back to the application with an authorization code, which is good for one use.
- Auth0's SDK sends this code to the Auth0 Authorization Server (
/oauth/token
endpoint) along with the application's Client ID and Client Secret.
- Your Auth0 Authorization Server verifies the code, Client ID, and Client Secret.
- Your Auth0 Authorization Server responds with an ID Token and Access Token (and optionally, a Refresh Token).
- Your application can use the Access Token to call an API to access information about the user.
- The API responds with requested data.

3. What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?
A way to handle Auth for sites that are single page applications and can't store their client secret beacause it could be seen in the browser.

4. What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?
The web app requests and obtains tokens through the front channel, without the need for secrets or extra backend calls. With this method, you don’t need to obtain, maintain, use, and protect a secret in your application.

5. What is Client Credentials Flow?
When M2M apps pass along their Client ID and Client Secret to authenticate themselves and get a token.

6. What is Device Authorization Flow?
With input-constrained devices that connect to the internet, rather than authenticate the user directly, the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device. This avoids a poor user experience for devices that do not have an easy way to enter text. 

7. What is Resource Owner Password Flow?
Highly-trusted applications can use the Resource Owner Password Flow, which requests that users provide credentials (username and password), typically using an interactive form.
