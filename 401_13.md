## Linear Regression

The main use of linear regression is to find the straight line that best fits a cloud of scattered data points.

What does it mean to find the best fit? For linear regression it means to minimize the y difference between the plotted line and the data points for a given x value. The difference (called a residual) for each point is found, squared to account for negative values, and then all values are summed. The line equation that minimizes the this total differnence is the best fit equation. This whole process can be described as **Ordinary least squares regression**.

When we set up our LR, we need to know what our explanatory (independent) and response (dependent) variables are.

The great thing about LR is that we can get back a mathematical score of the strength of the relationship between our two variables. This score is roughly speaking the slope of the best fit line.
