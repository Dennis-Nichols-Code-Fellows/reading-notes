# Code 401 - Reading 1

## Pain vs. Suffering

This reading imparts upon us that Python 401 will be HARD. There will be physical, mental, and emotional challenges.
But this is the path to improvement, to building value in our field, to excellence.
To deal with the pain of learning, we need to keep our reasons for taking this class in mind, to ask questions, and to build community to solve problems together.

## Beginner's Guide to Big O

Big O notation is what we use in computer science to describe the efficiency of an algorithm *in the worst case scenario*. We need a tool like this in order compare the performance of an algorithm across different platforms. Big O can be used both for describing the time complexity (how fast) and space complexity (how much memory used) of an algorithm.

- O(1) is constant time / space complexity. No matter what the innput is, the algorithm will always take the same amount of time to run.

- O(N) is linear complexity. The algorithm will take a growing amount of time in direct linear proportion to the size of the input.

- O(N<sup>2</sup>) is quadratic complexity. The complexity is in proportion to the square of the size of the input. This tends to happen when you have nested operations.

- Logarithmic complexity O(log(N)) occurs when for example the time to run an algorithm initially raises sharply in relation to input size but then levels off and is not greatly affected by increases in input size. An example of this would be binary search algorithms.

## Things I want to learn about

- I skimmed over the Python environment article and a lot of it was over my head so I will need to learn up on the referenced topics.
