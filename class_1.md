# Class 1 - Markdown

**Markdown** "is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents."

As opposed to a program like MS Word where you use a GUI to add formatting to your document, when you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

Below are some basic examples of how you can use Markdown syntax:

-To make a line a text a **heading** you precede the line with the symbol `#`.
For example `# Your text here` would render in the document as a top level header.

-To make text **bold** you surround the text with double asterisks on each side, like so: `**text**`.

**Markdown** becomes very useful on github when you want to share code examples. It can even be used to create full-fledged websites with *github pages* just like the one you're viewing right now :)
