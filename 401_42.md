# Code 401 - Class 42 Notes

## Dunder methods

Dunder methods allow you to emulate the behavior of built-in types when making your own custom classes. For example, you wouldn't normally be able to get the length of a custom object, but if you give it the `__len__` method you can!

The very first dunder method anyone needs is `__init__` which you must use a the constructor for a class.

The `__repr__` and `__str__` methods are also useful for providing a string representation of your object upon a print call.

## Iterators 

Python iterators are objects that enable iteration over a collection of elements, such as a list, tuple, or string. They provide a way to access each element of the collection in sequence, without having to know the underlying implementation details. To create an iterator, you define a class with the __iter__() and __next__() methods, which are used to iterate over the collection.

## Generators

Python generators are a special type of iterator that simplifies the process of writing custom iterators. They allow you to define a function that can be used to generate a sequence of values on-the-fly, as opposed to pre-computing them and storing them in a list. Generators are created using the yield keyword, which temporarily suspends the function and returns a value to the caller. When the generator is called again, it resumes execution from where it left off, allowing it to produce an infinite sequence of values if desired. Generators are particularly useful for working with large datasets, as they can save memory and improve performance by generating values on-demand.
