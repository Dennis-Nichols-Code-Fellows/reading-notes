## JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

JWT is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. The information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed using a secret key. JWTs are used for authentication and authorization purposes and are commonly used in RESTful APIs.

## Django Rest Framework JWT Authentication

Django Rest Framework (DRF) is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs. DRF provides support for authenticating users using JWT, allowing developers to easily add secure authentication to their APIs. With DRF JWT, user authentication is handled by passing a JWT in the HTTP Authorization header, which can then be used to verify the identity of the user making the request.

## Using Django and Gunicorn for Production Servers

Gunicorn is a popular and widely-used production server for Python applications, including Django. It is a pre-fork worker model, meaning that it forks multiple worker processes to handle incoming requests. Using Gunicorn with Django allows for improved performance and scalability compared to the built-in Django development server. Additionally, Gunicorn has features such as configurable number of worker processes, gracefully restarting worker processes, and the ability to bind to multiple addresses/ports.
