# Class 43 Notes - Ethics

## Ethics in the workplace

I read the article about the Google employees protesting that company's development of a censored web browser for China.
I applaud those employees and especially the ones that quit in response to project Maven. It was intersting to see how this demonstrates that employees can somtimes exercise more power than shareholders. I do worry now about that dynamic has changed recently with all the layoffs and the prospect that AI tools might enable even fewer employees to be employed. I think anything that shifts more of the balance from labor to capital is a bad thing. So I hope that more employees exercise the power they still have before it goes away.

## Ethics in technology

I read the article titled "Big Data is our Generation's Civil Rights", and it pointed out some really interesting things about how companies might use abundantly available data. This article was written back in 2012 and was pretty pessimistic even then so I'm sure the author would have an even darker view now. The fact that companies might make decisions about your credit worthiness based on where you shop and not even your personal credit history is pretty astounding. It's a good example of how racism can be baked into a system without it being explicit at all. If you just happen to shop at stores in a low income neighborhood then a company might make detrimental decisions about your credit worthiness. This creates a vicious cycle that ensures people who are already disadvantaged have an even harder time accessing the financial tools they need to ascend the economic ladder.
