## Serverless computing

Serverless is a cloud computing model that allows developers to bild and run app code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.
This lets programmers focus on their code and business logic without having to worry about scaling and infrastructure.

While the term is 'serverless', this is just referring to the experience of developers. There are of course servers being maintained by the cloud service provider. All major cloud providers today offer serverless services.

**Cloud-native = serverless computing + microservices + containers**

The compute model central to serverless is 'function-as-a-service' (FaaS).
Serverless services also include databases and storage, event streaming and messages, and API gateways.

A key feature of serverless is that provisioning times are measured in milliseconds and that users are only metered and charged on these timescales. Before, users might have had to pay for server time parceled in minutes or even hours.

Another big benefit is that a developer doesn't have to do any capacity planning with serverless. Furthermore, serverless is very efficient with resources. There is no such thing as idle capacity.
