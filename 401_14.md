# Code 401 - Class 14 Notes

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. The pyplot module provides a high-level interface for creating and customizing visualizations. It is particularly useful for creating line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, error bars, and many other types of plots. The pyplot module also provides functions for formatting plots, including setting plot titles, axis labels, and tick labels.

The tutorial from the link was useful for getting a simple introduction to some of the ways we can use pyplot.
It also showed an interesting application of the library for doing animations - I didn't realize that was possible before with matplotlib.

I also learned that Seaborn is built around matplotlib. I'm interested in learning more about this library because it seems like a quicker way to get clean figure out of data if you are less concerned about customizations.
