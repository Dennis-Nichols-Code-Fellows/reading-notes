## Classes and Objects

Objects are containers for attributes and functions (methods) that serve a similar purpose.

Classes are a template for creating new objects.

An object created from a class is known as an instance.

### `__init__()`

This function is used to allow one to pass in new values for attributes to a class instance.

```python
class MyClass:

  def __init__(self, number, name):
    self.number = number
    self.name = name
  
  def print_name(self):
    print("Hello {self.name}")
```

## Thinking recursively in Python

The essence of thinking recursively in Python is to break down large problems into smaller and smaller problems.

### Formal definition of recursion

A recursive function is one that is defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.

All recursive functions have two parts: a base case and a recursive case.

Behind the scenes, each recursive call adds a layer to the call stack until we get to the base case. Then the call stack starts resolving from the top back down to the original call.

### Maintaining state

With recursion you either have to make it so that the current state is part of the current call's execution content **or** state is maintained with a global variable.

## Recursive data structures in Python

A data structure is recursive if it can be deÔ¨Åned in terms of a smaller version of itself.

Examples of a recursive data structure include the python list (arrray), trees, sets, dictionaries, etc.

### Naive fibonacci numbers

It makes recursion more efficient in Python if you use the lru_cache decorator.

## Pytest fixtures and coverage

Fixtures allows you to have certain objects and resources available to all of your tests instead of having to create them each time a test is run.

The fixture though, is actually a function that returns a value or Object and not simply a global variable. This lets it do calculations and make decisions.

You can optionally provide the fixture set up and tear down functionality.

You can use the pytest-cov package to check how much of the paths through your functions are actually covered by tests.
