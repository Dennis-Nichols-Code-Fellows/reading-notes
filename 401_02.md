## TDD with Python

- The idea behind TDD is to write tests, THEN code.
- In the long run, this should save time on debugging and it also encourages writing the minimum code necessary to pass a test. This in turn encourages more design thinking.
- One common phrase used to describe the TDD process is red-green-refactor.
  - Write the test first, run it and see it fail (red).
  - Work on the function you are testing until it passes (in the greeen).
  - Refactor your code to be more readable and/or efficient while still passing the tests.

## If `__name__` equals `__main__`

- `__name__` is a special variable that Python sets behind the scene for a given script/module.
- When the script is run as a stand-alone script, `__name__` equals `__main__` but when it's run as a module, `__name__` equals the name of the module.
- Knowing the above lets files act both as reusable modules or stand-alone scripts which is pretty convenient.

## Recursion

- Recursion is the process of a function calling itself directly or indirectly.
- A recursive function solves a problem by calling a copy of itself on smaller and smaller subproblems of the original problem.
- These functions must include a **base case** that lets the recursive process terminate.
- Recursion makes certain problems much easier to solve and sometimes improves readability.
