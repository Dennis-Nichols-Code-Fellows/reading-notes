## Django Forms

Django forms allows for creating and handling HTML forms. It provides a way to create forms and handle form data in a way that is secure, efficient and easy to use. The module includes several built-in form fields and widgets, such as text input, textarea, checkbox, and select, and allows developers to create custom form fields and widgets as well. This removes a lot of developer headache in constructing forms and ensuring field validation from scratch.

Django forms uses a form class to define the fields and validation rules for a form. The form class is then rendered as an HTML form and displayed in a template. The form data is then passed to the form class for validation and cleaning before it is processed by the view function. This way, developers can handle form data in a structured and consistent way, and can easily add validation and security features to their forms.

Django forms also provide the ability to handle forms with file uploads, by using the "FileField" and "ImageField" classes. These fields automatically handle the file upload process, including any file validation and storage. These forms also provide built-in support for CSRF protection, which helps to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks. This protection is automatically applied to all forms rendered using the Django forms module. Additionally, it allows to use ModelForm, which is a form generated from a django model, this way it is possible to create, edit, and delete objects from the database using forms, without writing any form fields.
