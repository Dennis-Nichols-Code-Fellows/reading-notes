## [Troubleshooting JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

### Questions

**1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**

- Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. (MDN docs)
- These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.

**2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**

- In today's assignment - one error I encountered was in calling certain functions out of order - this was a logic error I suppose. I first realized that something was wrong by checking the console for errors in the brower. Then I looked up my error and eventually got a hint from a stackoverflow post that my script tag was misplaced within my html file.

**3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**

- This topic will be a huge portion of my life as a dev. Getting better at understanding and troubleshooting errors will make my future jobs much easier and productive.

## [The JS Debugger](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

**1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**

- Imagine you are baking a cake but it doesn't come out right. When you go back through the recipe and check if you followed it correctly at each step, this is kind of like what the JavaScript debugger does. The debugger allows us to check how our code is working at different steps and narrow down where problems are.

**2. Define what a breakpoint is.**

- Places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly. (MDN docs)

**3. What is the call stack?**

- The Call stack shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. (MDN docs)
