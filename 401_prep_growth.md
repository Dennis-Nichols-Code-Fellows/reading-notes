# Growth Mindset Notes

## Deliberate Practice

- It's not enough to just build the same kind of websites over and over again if you want to improve your skills.
- You need to put in dedicated practice time on new subjects or existing things that you find difficult.

**Deliberate Practice** should:

- Push you outside of your comfort zone
- Be repeated often
- Require a lot of mental effort
- Have defined goals

## Carol Dweck on Growth Mindset

Dr. Dweck's talk basically boils down to the 'power of yet'. When you encounter difficulties, a growth mindset will see these as a challenge that has not been solved YET whereas a fixed mindset will internalize the failure and look for alternative ways to assuage the ego. According to Dr. Dweck, this simple reframing of YET has lead to huge improvements in class performance in some schools.

## Grit

According to Dr. Duckworth, "Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon, not a sprint." She says that this quality has more explanatory power about why people are successful than base intelligence or many other factors.

## Alain de Bottom's Philosophy of Success

To me the essential insight of this talk are that we need to be careful to acknowledge the elements of randomness both in our lives and those of others. If we, rightly, acknowledge that there's a lot of chance involved in life outcomes, we can be more kind to ourselves and others.

Another key point relates to defining what success means for ourselves. It behooves us to understand where our values come from - are we adopting the values of others, or are they ones that we wholeheartedly believe in ourselves?

## Emotional Intelligence

Based on the survey, my strengths are self-awareness and management, whereas my weaknesses are social awareness and relationship management. This is basically in line with my existing understanding - I've grown to usually be able to recognize the factors behind a given mood I'm experiencing. Usually this allows me to manage said mood but sometimes I act on emotion before reflecting like I should. When it comes to other people, I often can identify someone's base emotional state well but I am less good at figuring out the motivations behind other's actions. Occasionally, I manage relationships poorly because of prioritizing some personal principle over the other person's feelings.

## Cognitive Bias

I scored lower on the empathy and curiosity section, but I personally believe this is because some of the questions are tuned more towards assessing extroversion/introversion rather than anything bias related. But yeah, it's fair to say that I can be lazy about getting to know people sometimes or at least it's easier for me to reach out when I know we have some common interests from the start. I do think I'm generally pretty good about changing my perspective based on new information. In terms of how to act, I think the most effective thing we can do is act with respect in our personal interactions.

## Things I wanna know more about

I guess I'd be curious about how much evidence there is for any of these theories. Also what the testable definiton of 'grit' is for example. The assertions about the importance of grit are presumably based on associative studies of students early life characteristics and future life outcomes. However this all comes to down to what was measured. So yeah, something to maybe look into someday.
