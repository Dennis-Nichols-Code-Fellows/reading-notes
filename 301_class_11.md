## [NoSQL vs SQL](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

1. Table below
|  SQL      | NoSQL     |
| :---------: | :---------: |
| table-based | document-based |
| pre-defined schema | dynamic schema |
| better for complex queries | doesn't have standard interfaces for complex queries |
| not suited to hierarchical data |  better for hierarchical data due to key-value storage |

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Non-hierachical.

3. Give a real world example.
Relational data-tables like tables of transactions paired with tables of customer information.

4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Hierarchical data.

5. Give a real world example.
Data which is structured in relationship to a company's org tree.

6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
Document-based / NoSQL.

7. Which type of database is best for scalability?
Both are scalable in different ways, but noSQL is probably more easily scaled since it's easier to run a process on multiple servers than increasing the power of a single server.

1. What does SQL stand for?
Structured query language.

2. What is a relational database?
A database made up of data tables which are linked (relate) to each other based on certain values.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
With tables.

4. What is a ‘schema’?
The requirements of what kind of data can go in a table.

5. What is a NoSQL database?
A database that uses collections instead of tables.

6. How does it work?
All the data you need for a certain task is stored in one place as opposed in different tables that you need to relate.

7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?
Collections (sort of like tables) -> documents (sort of like rows but they can have different fields (schemas) in comparison with each other)

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDB because the schema is dynamic - new fields can be added all the time.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
Duplicate data -more storage and all needs to be updated.
