## Working with files in Python

### Composition of files

- header -> metadata
- data
- EOF -> special character to indicate end of file

### line endings

- depending on the OS, lines will end in different characters
- For windows, lines will end in \r\n
- For other platforms, lines will end in \n

### opening and closing files

It's best to just use a context manager like the `with` statement to handle opening and closing files.

### Text file types

- plain old .txt files are the most common you will encounter
- there are also buffered binary files that require you to use the `rb` and `wb` modes.

### Reading and writing opened files

- use .read() to return the whole file in one string
- use .readlines() to return a list of lines
- use .readline() to iterate line by line through the file
- you can just use the file alias from the with command and iterate over that
  - this is reccomended since it is more memory efficient

## Python exceptions

There area 2 types of errors in Python, **exceptions** and **syntax errors**.

- A syntax error will occur when the parser encounters incorrectly written code.
- An exception will occur syntactically correct code is run but results in an error.

### AssertionError

We can make our code throw an error if a condition evaluates to false.

### Try / except / else / finally Block

The `try` block contains code that may throw an exception, and the `except` block contains code that is executed if an exception is caught. For example, if you want to open a file and read its contents, you might use a `try` block to open the file and an `except` block to handle the exception that occurs if the file does not exist. You can also use multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions. The `else` block is optional and is executed if no exceptions are thrown in the `try` block. The `finally` block is optional and holds code that is executed if no matter what happens.

## Things I want to know more about

It would be good to get more context on when it is appropriate to raise your own exceptions.
