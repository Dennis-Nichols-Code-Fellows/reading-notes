# Code 201 - Class 04 notes

## Learn HTML

- [Creating Hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

### Topic 1 importance

Hyperlinks are basically what makes 'The Web' a web (MDN docs).
They bind all the pages of the web together.
The original Google search algorithm was innovative because it used the number of links pointing to a given page to give that page a rank.

### Topic 1 Questions

**1. To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**

- The anchor element `<a>`.

**2.The href attribute contains what information?**

- The href attribute contains the URL of the page we are linking  to.

**3.What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**

- The link text should have useful/descriptive keywords in it.

## Learn CSS

-[CSS Layout: Normal Flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Normal_Flow)
-[CSS Layout: Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning)

### Topic 2 importance

It is important to understand the concepts of normal flow and positioning to creat visually appealing sites that direct the user to important page elements.

### Topic 2 Questions

**1.What is meant by “normal flow”?**

- This describes how elements are laid out on the page using the default browser settings. In these settings, elements are laid out in 'block flow direction'. This means that each element will appear on a new line below the previous element. (MDN docs)

**2.What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?**

- Block-level elements have content that dills the available in-line space of the parent element containing it (MDN docs). They are laid out in the 'block flow direction' as mentioned above.

- The size of inline elements is just the size of their content. (MDN docs). In-line elements appear on the same line as other inline elements if they fit based on their size.

**3.___ positioning is the default for every html element.**

- Static

**4.Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**

- "it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. For example, popup information boxes, control menus, rollover panels, UI features that can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the page, and so on." -MDN docs

**5.What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**

- "whereas absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. " - MDN docs

## Learn JS

- [Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)

### Topic 3 importance

Functions are important for increasing the reusability and readibility of code.

### Topic 3 Questions

**1.Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**

- A function declaration defines the name of the function and the operations it will perform. The invocation will initiate the actions of the function.

**2.What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**

- A parameter is the defined in the function declaration, an argument is given in the function invocation.

## Miscellaneous

-[6 reasons for pair programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

**1.Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**

- Engaged collaboration. Creating a community feeling around programming will improve my ability to focuse on problems over a long time.

- Learning from fellow students. It's good to get different perspectives on how to solve a problem.

## Things I want to learn more about

- I need to go deeper into CSS positioning.
