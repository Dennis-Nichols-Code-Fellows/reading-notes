# Class 6 - Javascript

Javascript! JS is the programming and scripting language of the web. It also used to power applications.

Javascript has standards set by the ECMAScript Language specification.

## [Input/Output in JS](https://code-maven.com/input-output-in-plain-javascript)

This article illustrates a simple example of how JS can be used to add interactivity to a website. JS is the means of tying together different variables (some of which are user input) and returning a response to the user based on some user action.

## Javascript Variables

One of the most important concepts in JS or any programming language is that of variables.

**Variables** are containers for storing data values.

There are 3 different ways to declare a variable in JS:

1. var -> used in older web browsers -> takes the form `var price1 = 20;`
2. const -> used since 2015 -> for variables that should not change -> takes the form `const total = 5;`
3. let -> used since 2015 -> for variables whose values may change -> `let whales = 500;`

Variables can be added to other variables and the result may be added to a new variable. `let c = a + b`

Varibles must be identified with **unique** names. These names must typically start with a letter. Some words are reserved by the JS language and may not be used as variable names.

A single `=` is known as the assignment operator.

It is possible to declare a variable (`let dog`) and assign a variable `dog = 'hungry'` in two different steps.

You may also declare multiple variables in one statement:

`let dragon = 'Drogon', house = 'Targaryan', queen = 'Daenarys';`
