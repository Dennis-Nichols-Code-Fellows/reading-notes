# Code 401 - Class 29 notes

## Custom User Model

- Django highly recommends using a custom user model for the long term even though it comes with a default user model.
- A key point in setting up the custom user model is that you wait to do migrations until AFTER you have set it up.

### Custom model creation steps

1. Update settings.py

- add the new app to the app dir list
- set `AUTH_USER_MODEL` = `CustomUser` (or whatever you want to call it.)

2. Create a new  `CustomUser` model.

- update the app/models.py with a new User model called `CustomUser`

3. Create a new `UserCreation` and `UserChangeForm`.

4. Update the admin settings.


## DjangoX

This is a 'batteries-included' starter project.

Not a lot in the readme other than install instructions so I may check out one of the recommended books.

## Things I want to know more about

What kind of things could have gone wrong with the user model and my tests yesterday.
